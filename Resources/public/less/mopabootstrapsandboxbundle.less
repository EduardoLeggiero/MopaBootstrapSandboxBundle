 * Import this file in your less files as first to be abled to access less vars from your file
 * OR
 * Add it to the stylesheets of assetic or 
 * Add it as described on http://www.lesscss.org with the less.js (maybe pathes must be adapted in that case)
 *
 * Be careful when using less this way, might be most straight forward, but assetic doesnt check the included files 
 * for changes, and will only regenerate the css if it detects changes in this file!
 * 
 * For development it might be easier to include all you less files in the layout directly
 * But then assetic will compile each less file in a own compiler session so you cant mix in the less style into bootstrap, which might not be OK
